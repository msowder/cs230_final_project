* 3 ounces fresh goat cheese, at room temperature
* 1 tablespoon prepared pesto
* 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, plus 1 teaspoon lemon zest
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 12 slices bacon, halved crosswise
* 
* 1. Position an oven rack in the center of the oven, and preheat the broiler. Slice the figs about 3/4 of the way down the center lengthwise, and open each like a book; set aside.
* 2. Combine the goat cheese, pesto, lemon juice and zest and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper in a small bowl with a rubber spatula. Fill each fig with about 1 teaspoon of the cheese-pesto mixture.
* 3. Wrap each stuffed fig with a slice of bacon, and secure with a toothpick. Put the figs, seam-side down, on a rimmed baking sheet.
* 4. Broil, turning once, until the bacon is cooked through and crispy, about 4 to 5 minutes per side.
